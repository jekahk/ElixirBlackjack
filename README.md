## About The Project

<div align="center">

</div>

The task for this project was to select a programming language that was new for the student and then use it to build some sort of game. The game idea could be selected from a predetermined list, or the student could come up with an own idea. The purpose was to get to know a new programming language and concentrate on how this language supported this programming project. This project idea was selected from the predetermined list. The project could be done as solo or in a group up to 4 persons. This project was done solo. 

This project started with some initial brainstorming about what the finished game should include. The initial plan can be viewed in the "initial ideas.txt" document. The product of this project is a terminal based Blackjack, other name Twenty-one, card game written whit Elixir programming language. The game has a save system that keeps track of the players balance, betting system and simple interface that displace the dealers hand and the players’ hand.
